Event Subscriber - Ethereum Smart Contract Event Listener
Overview
Event Subscriber is a Python-based tool that connects to an Ethereum node, listens for specific smart contract events, and logs them. It includes additional features such as email alerts for large withdrawals and transaction simulation.

Features
Connects to an Ethereum node using Web3.py.
Monitors and filters smart contract events in real time.
Logs events with timestamps.
Alerts users via email for large withdrawals (configurable threshold).
Supports transaction simulation for testing.
User-friendly command-line interface.
Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Web3 (pip install web3)
asyncio (included with Python)
colorama (pip install colorama)
pyfiglet (pip install pyfiglet)
argparse (included with Python)
logging (included with Python)
smtplib (included with Python)
json (included with Python)

Installation
Clone or download this repository.

Install dependencies using:
pip install web3 colorama pyfiglet

Usage
Run the script:
python event_subscriber.py

Provide required inputs:
Ethereum node URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:8545 for Ganache).
Smart contract address.
Path to the contract ABI file.
Event name(s) to listen for.
Polling interval (default: 10 seconds).
(Optional) Enable transaction simulation:
Choose y when prompted to simulate a transaction.

(Optional) Enable email alerts:
Enter your email credentials if you want alerts for large withdrawals.

Key Functions
setup_logging()
Initializes logging to record detected events.

get_valid_url()
Prompts the user for an Ethereum node connection URL and validates it.

get_contract()
Loads a smart contract using the user-provided address and ABI.

get_event_filters()
Allows the user to select events to monitor.

event_handler(event, event_name)
Handles and logs detected events.

send_email_alert(message)
Sends email alerts for large withdrawals.

event_loop(event_filters, interval)
Continuously monitors events.

simulate_transaction(web3, contract)
Simulates a transaction for testing.

Example Output
Enter connection URL for Ethereum node (default is Ganache http://127.0.0.1:8545):
Enter contract address:
Enter path to contract ABI file:
Enter starting block number for event filter (default is 'latest'):
Enter ending block number for event filter (default is 'latest'):
Enter event name to filter for (or leave empty to finish): Withdrawal
Enter polling interval in seconds: 10
Do you want to simulate a transaction? (y/n): y

Starting event loop...
Filtering for event 'Withdrawal' from block latest to latest.
Polling every 10 seconds.

New Withdrawal event detected!
Block Number: 12345
Transaction Hash: 0xabc123...
Arguments: {'amount': 5000000000000000000, 'to': '0xUserAddress'}

Notes
The script assumes an Ethereum node is running (e.g., Ganache for local testing).
Ensure the contract ABI file is correctly formatted JSON.
The large withdrawal threshold is set to 10 ETH by default but can be modified.
